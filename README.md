Food order using api

Mimic a real life website for a restaurant.

Mainly 5 tasks are done when you go in a restaurant. You get the menu and then Someone takes your order. Then your order is given to the chef and the chef starts preparing it. Once food is cooked, the food is given to the waiter and the waiter gives the food to you. then you eat it and pay for it.An alert is shown with thank you message.

* Everyting is logged into the console as no ui is used or build for the site!
